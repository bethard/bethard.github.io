# Welcome #

I am an Associate Professor at the [School of Information](http://ischool.arizona.edu/) at the [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/) with courtesy appointments in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/), [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.arizona.edu/), [Computer Science](https://cs.arizona.edu/), and [Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/).

I previously worked
as an assistant professor in [Computer and Information Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://cis.uab.edu/),
and as a postdoctoral researcher at
[Stanford University's Natural Language Processing group](http://nlp.stanford.edu),
[Johns Hopkins University's Human Language Technology Center of Excellence](http://hltcoe.jhu.edu/),
[KULeuven's Language Intelligence and Information Retrieval group](http://liir.cs.kuleuven.be/) in Belgium,
and the [University of Colorado's Center for Language and Education Research](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/).

My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning theory and applications, including modeling the language of time and timelines, normalizing text to medical and geospatial ontologies, and information extraction models for clinical applications.
There is a large community at the University of Arizona pursuing similar natural language processing research. Visit us at: <http://nlp.arizona.edu/>
