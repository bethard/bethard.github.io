# Prospective students #

I am not taking on any additional students at this time, as I am on sabbatical.

# Graduate assistants #

Please do not email me asking for teaching assistant positions.
Teaching assistant positions are assigned by the department; I have no role in that process.

Please do not email me asking for research assistant positions.
When I have funding for student research, I allocate it to students who are already working in my lab, typically my doctoral students.
