# Prospective students #

I will not be taking on any additional Ph.D. students before Fall 2027 at the earliest.

I am also not taking on any advisees who are not currently students at the University of Arizona.

If you are a current University of Arizona undergraduate or masters student, I will be taking on one-semester directed research students in Fall 2025 to work on [SemEval 2026](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2026/) shared tasks.
If you are interested in such a directed research, wait until the SemEval 2026 tasks are announced (probably in August 2025), then send me an email with which task you would like to participate in, and a list of your prior experience and/or coursework in natural language processing and machine learning.
I will select a small number of directed research students from the best such applications.

# Graduate assistants #

Please do not email me asking for paid teaching assistant positions.
Teaching assistant positions are assigned by the department; I have no role in that process.

Please do not email me asking for paid research assistant positions.
When I have funding for student research, I allocate it to students who are already working in my lab, typically my doctoral students.
